1) You need to have a my sql database installed on your computer
2) Airlow needs to be installed and set up on your computer
3) Copy the dag.py script to the appropriate dag folder on your computer
4) Download chrome driver on your computer
5) Edit the nba_dag.py script and edit your database credentials and also update the CHROME_PATH variable to the path you stored the chrome driver on your computer.
6) Your can run the jupyter notebook from the beginning to the end if you do not want to use airflow. You would need to re-run it though everytime you want to update your nba database.
7) copy the python files to your airflow "dag" folder on your system
8) Initialize the airflow db, start the web server and scheduler
9) turn on the nba DAG

10) you would also need to install MySQL
11) To install MySQL on WSL (Ubuntu 20.04), which is what i am using as i am running my airflow using WSL2 rather than docker:

Open your WSL terminal (ie. Ubuntu 20.04).

Update your Ubuntu packages: sudo apt update

Once the packages have updated, install MySQL with: sudo apt install mysql-server

Confirm installation and get the version number: mysql --version

You may also want to run the included security script. 

This changes some of the less secure default options for things like remote root logins and sample users. To run the security script:

Start a MySQL server: sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
Start the security script prompts: sudo mysql_secure_installation
The first prompt will ask whether youâ€™d like to set up the Validate Password Plugin, which can be used to test the strength of your MySQL password. 

You will then set a password for the MySQL root user, 
decide whether or not to remove anonymous users, 
decide whether to allow the root user to login both locally and remotely, 
decide whether to remove the test database, and, lastly, 
decide whether to reload the privilege tables immediately.

To open the MySQL prompt, enter: sudo mysql


12) Also, you would need to replace YOUR_SYSTEM_USER with the username you have)

$ sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> CREATE USER 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWD';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;

$ sudo service mysql restart
