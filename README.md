A Full-Stack Data Science Project implemented with data i got from the NBA Website.

- Extracted, cleaned and structured the data i needed using python
- Used the data extracted to build a custom MySQL database of NBA players.
- Pulled the data from MySQL using pandas and ran an extensive data analysis on it in order to obtain useful insites
- Used a machine learning model to extablish the importance of each feature and identify how the model makes its decision.
